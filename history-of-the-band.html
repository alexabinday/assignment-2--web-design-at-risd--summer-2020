    <h3>Legacies</h3>
      <blockquote cite="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Public_Enemy_(band)">
        <p>Public Enemy made contributions to the hip-hop world with sonic experimentation as well as
          political and cultural consciousness, which infused itself into skilled and poetic rhymes. Public Enemy
          held a strong, pro-black, political stance, before the band, politically motivated hip-hop was
          defined by a few tracks by few artists. Public Enemy was a revolutionary hip-hop act whose entire image
          rested on a specified political stance. With the successes of Public Enemy, many hip-hop artists began
          to celebrate Afrocentric themes more. The revolutionary influence of the band is seen throughout
          hip-hop and is recognized in society and politics. The band "rewrote the rules of hip-hop", changing the
          image, sound and message forever. Pro-black lyrics brought political and social themes to hardcore
          hip hop, with stirring ideas of racial equality, and retribution against police brutality, aimed at
          disenfranchised blacks, but appealing to all the poor and underrepresented. Before Public Enemy,
          hip hop music was seen as "throwaway entertainment", with trite sexist and homophobic lyrics.
          Public Enemy brought social relevance and strength to hip hop.</p>

    <h3>Controversies</h3>
      <h4>Martin Luther King</h4>
        <blockquote>
          <p>When the 1991 Album released, a song named "By the Time I get to Arizona", featured a video depicting
            one of the members killing Arizona officials with a machine gun and car bombs. This was referencing the controversy of
            the Arizona officials cancelling the Martin Luther King holiday that year. The violent video attracted negative media
            attention.</p>
        </blockquote>

      <h4>Anti-Semitism</h4>
      <blockquote>
          <p>In one instance, in an interview with Public Enemy during 1989 with the Washington Times, the interviewing
            journalist, David Mills, lifted some quotations from a UK magazine where the band were asked on their
            opinions on the Arab–Israeli conflict. Their comments apparently sympathized with the Palestinians,
            so he was accused of anti-Semitism, "Jews are responsible for the majority of the wickedness in the world"</p>
          <p>Thus this prompted a reaction from the band. Where Public Enemy issued the single "Welcome to the Terrordome" in 1990, which contained the lyrics:
              "Crucifixion ain't no fiction / So-called chosen frozen / Apologies made to whoever pleases / Still
              they got me like Jesus". These lyrics was seen by some in the media as anti-Semitic, as it seemed to
              references to the concept of "chosen people" with the lyric "so-called chosen".</p>

    <h3>Review on the Band</h3>
      <blockquote cite="https://www.slantmagazine.com/music/public-enemy-it-takes-a-nation-of-millions-to-hold-us-back/">
        <p>One time someone asked me who my favorite rap artist was. Mentally flipping through a
          list that included Missy Elliott and Kanye West, and not wanting to seem either too stupid
          or too gay, I blurted out, “Public Enemy.” After popping in a Lil Wayne remix, this
          person arched his eyebrows and looked down. “Public Enemy? They’re trouble.”
          Well, yeah, that’s the whole idea. Still recording after 20 years, the group’s
          call-it-like-it-is ethos remains intact, even though Chuck D has resorted to
          collaborating with Moby and using bad puns like “Head Wide Shut” to get his message
          across. As the group has grown up, so has hip-hop: While Public Enemy may have cleared
          the way for everyone from Eminem to M.I.A., the mix of outrage and anarchic humor that
          once defined their brand of political hip-hop no longer has a place in a genre that has
          thoroughly saturated pop culture not just stateside, but in about every other
          industrialized country too.</p>

        <p>The death knell of hip-hop’s relevance came earlier this year when the Black Eyed Peas’
           will.i.am released the video for his song “Yes We Can,” a humorless PSA-in-disguise for
           Barack Obama starring a bunch of famous people like John Legend, Common, and Scarlett
           Johansson. It wasn’t exactly a rap song (it wasn’t really a song at all), but it represents
           what rap has become. Polemics like “Fuck tha Police” and “Fight the Power” have given way to
           embarrassingly earnest and stilted political music with no room for antics: Eminem leading
           us “through the darkness” in “Mosh”; Ludacris and West shilling for Al Gore at Live Earth.
           These efforts take their cue from Public Enemy, but they’re self-consciously aware of
           their new position in the pop marketplace. Instead of battling their way from the bottom
           up, they are thoroughly perched at the top with all the other superstars, looking down.</p>

        <p>So it’s hard not to approach the 20th anniversary of Public Enemy’s sophomore album and
           magnum opus, It Takes a Nation of Millions to Hold Us Back, with a little bit of
           bitterness and a lot of nostalgia. It was the first time a hip-hop album had topped
           The Village Voice’s Pazz & Jop poll, at a time when a major rap artist could say
           “Don’t believe the hype” without any hint of irony. Which isn’t to say the genre isn’t
           going places: After releasing her own sophomore album, Kala, the industry already wants
           to anoint M.I.A. the new queen of music that gives a shit. But Public Enemy and M.I.A.
           are very different artists who come from very different places. An artist who uses beats
           like weapons, M.I.A. has militant-chic appeal, but for all her record sales she’s not
           exactly trying to disrupt the mainstream; “Nobody wants to be dancing to political
           songs,” she said in an interview before the release of her debut in 2004.</p>

        <p>In hindsight, it’s best to see Public Enemy as the first and maybe only successful
          hip-hop group whose music extended directly from their politics, and not the other way
          around. Born into activism and influenced by the now-outmoded ideas of Louis Farrakhan’s
          Nation of Islam, Chuck D didn’t just unsettle the middle class—he lobbed a “loud,
          obnoxious” bomb at it, to steal a phrase from Rolling Stone’s review of It Takes a Nation
          in its list of 500 Greatest Albums. Public Enemy stole from rock in more ways than sound:
          They adopted the bratty swagger of a punk band, filtered it through a DJ’s turntable, and
          wrote about what it was like to be black. The success of It Takes a Nation was,
          in part, a product of its own insistence; on “Bring the Noise,” the closest thing to
          a Chuck D manifesto, he defies the listener, black radio stations, and rock critics
          alike to pay attention: “Whatcha gonna do?/Rap is not afraid of you.”</p>

        <p>Calling Public Enemy “underground” is a misnomer. Though they agitated authority, their
          universal beats spoke to anyone and everyone with simple honesty. It was easy, even
          natural, to see Do the Right Thing’s frustrated Brooklyn nobodies bumping to
          “Fight the Power.” Chuck D uses It Takes a Nation as a sounding board.
          The famously hectic, swerving beats, samples, and sirens form the backdrop to his urgent
          political protest: At the same time they seduce, distract, and confuse the picture,
          they also force you to listen to the words he’s spinning. The classic Public Enemy song
          (“Bring the Noise,” “Don’t Believe the Hype”) starts with a sample that forms the basis
          for Chuck D’s sinewy stream of consciousness. Eventually, Flavor Flav, playing comic
          relief, will cut in riffing on a situation or a question (“Yo, Chuck, they’re saying
          we’re too black, man”), Chuck will answer, and so on. It feels like a busy conversation
          or a raucous party, but above the white noise, there’s always Chuck D, making sense of
          things. If hip-hop is “CNN for black people,” as the rapper suggested, then he’s its
          ultimate pundit.</p>

        <p>Like a much funnier version of Green Day’s “American Idiot,” It Takes a Nation
          purposefully plays on paranoia about government, cops, and the media. Chuck D talks in
          street codes (he likes to call people “suckers”), but his lyrics build surprisingly
          complex narratives out of simple observations. On “Black Steel in the Hour of
          Chaos,” an annoying draft letter becomes a symbol of the U.S. government’s handed-down
          tradition of slave-labor tactics: “I wasn’t wit’ it, but just that very minute/It
          occurred to me/The suckers had authority.” The static-like beats and jumbled words in
          “She Watch Channel Zero?!” stand in for television’s manufactured truth (the album’s
          intro famously says “the revolution will not be televised”), and “Night of the Living
          Baseheads” likens crack-cocaine use to an infectious beat. Above it all hangs
          Malcolm X’s quote, “Too black, too strong,” which Public Enemy plays twice and
          embraces as its own mantra. If the group plays to stereotype by acting like an
          angry mob, they also reclaim their outrage and use it to subvert wrongheaded ideas
          about black life.</p>

        <p>It Takes a Nation is universally taken to be the best rap album ever made. That’s not
          opinion but empirical fact: Not only have Rolling Stone, NME, Vibe, and Q all said so,
          but it’s also the only hip-hop album that ranks in the first 100 on Rolling Stone’s
          Greatest Albums list. By comparison, the record peaked at a relatively low #42 on the
          Billboard album chart when it first came out. Because of the media sensation he created,
          we tend to think of Chuck D as a cultural authority, but in most obvious ways It Takes a
          Nation—the “greatest” hip-hop has ever produced—doesn’t fulfill the conventional
          expectations of its genre, which may go a long way toward explaining its unique
          popularity with rock critics.</p>

        <p>The Bomb Squad’s avant-garde production made music out of a wreck of sounds. It wasn’t
          just the samples, from sources as varied as Queen and Stevie Wonder, but how they were
          used. Everyday noises like turntable scratches bumped up against live recordings of
          political speeches, a saxophone in “Show Em Whatcha Got,” and the rock crunch of the
          Beastie Boys-inspired “Party for Your Right to Fight.” Nothing if not democratic,
          Chuck D also didn’t self-mythologize in the same way as Notorious B.I.G. or Jay-Z.
          The clattering nature of Public Enemy favored more voices, not less, in the end
          fulfilling the hinted promise of crossover rap during the late ’80s: “Run DMC first said
          a deejay could be a band/Stand on its feet, get you out your seat,” Chuck D rhymes on
          “Bring the Noise.” He used the casual language of black culture, but he also took his
          own advice to “reach the bourgeois/Rock the boulevard.”</p>

        <p>“I gotta speak the truth, man/Doing what we feel/For the music is the proof.”
          That’s a line from A Tribe Called Quest’s 1991 masterpiece The Low End Theory, but it
          might as well have been lifted from It Takes a Nation. Later groups like Quest and De
          La Soul, arguably responsible for the two other greatest rap albums ever made,
          introduced the world to jazzy, soulful hip-hop, but in their laughably titled
          collective Native Tongues Posse (they all came from the outskirts of Manhattan), they
          shared with Public Enemy a commitment to experimental sounds and authentic, outspoken
          visions of urban life—and from there it’s not too hard to trace the lineage of artists
          like M.I.A. and Common. Less positively, it’s hard to imagine a racist missive like Ice
          Cube’s “Black Korea”— which eerily foreshadowed the strife of the Rodney King
          riots—without It Takes a Nation, an album that, for better or worse, gave rap its
          social trenchancy. In hip-hop’s circle of life, it wasn’t so much what Public Enemy was
          spitting, but the boldness with which they put it out there—putting their voices on the
          airwaves and asking, “Can I get a witness?”</p>
